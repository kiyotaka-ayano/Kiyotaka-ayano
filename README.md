# Hi, I'm Banchi 👋

## About Me
I am a self-taught developer and a college student with a strong interest in programming, problem-solving, and continuous learning.

I started learning **HTML, CSS, and C++** independently. While I still have much to learn, I consider myself at an **intermediate level** and actively work to improve my skills every day.

Currently, I am learning **JavaScript** and expanding my understanding of how the web works from both the frontend and logical perspectives.
